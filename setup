# Troubleshooting Icecast2 & Lighttpd: Permissions and Service Restart

This document explains the steps to fix issues when restarting the `icecast2` or `lighttpd` services related to directory permissions.

---

## 1. Icecast2 Issues

When trying to restart Icecast2 with:

```bash
sudo /etc/init.d/icecast2 restart

You may see output like:

[....] Restarting icecast2 (via systemctl): icecast2.se[ ok .

If the service does not run properly or there are permission errors, follow these steps.

1.1 Check and fix directory ownership

# Change ownership of configuration and log directories
sudo chown -R icecast2:icecast /etc/icecast2
sudo chown -R icecast2:icecast /var/log/icecast2

1.2 Check and fix directory permissions

sudo chmod -R 755 /var/log/icecast2

1.3 Restart the Icecast2 service

sudo systemctl restart icecast2
sudo systemctl status icecast2

If active (running) appears, the service is running normally.

2. Lighttpd Issues

For Lighttpd, common problems are related to permissions on the log, cache, and run directories.

2.1 Check and fix directory ownership

sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/log/lighttpd
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/cache/lighttpd
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/run/lighttpd

2.2 Check and fix directory permissions

sudo chmod -R 750 /var/log/lighttpd
sudo chmod -R 750 /var/cache/lighttpd
sudo chmod -R 750 /var/run/lighttpd

2.3 Restart the Lighttpd service

sudo systemctl restart lighttpd
sudo systemctl status lighttpd

Make sure active (running) appears.

3. Additional Notes

Always check the user running the service (icecast2 for Icecast2, www-data for Lighttpd).

Incorrect directory permissions are a common cause of services failing to start.

Only change ownership and permissions for service-related directoriesâ€”avoid modifying root /.

This document is intended to simplify troubleshooting Icecast2 and Lighttpd on Linux servers (Debian/Armbian).

If you want, I can also make a **compact copy-paste version** for English that you can just run in the terminal without extra reading. Do you want me to do that?
